Adhere strictly to established architecture design principles, ensuring clean separation of concerns, single responsibility, high readability, and maintainability. 
When modifying or introducing code, explicitly follow clean code practices (clear naming, modularity, encapsulation, and minimal dependencies). 
Clearly state the rationale behind significant architectural choices. 
Prompt for user validation before applying large-scale or structural refactoring.
