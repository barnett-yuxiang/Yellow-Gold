# Clean Architecture and Clean Code
- Follow established architecture design principles, ensuring clear separation of concerns and single responsibility.
- Explicitly apply clean code practices, including clear naming conventions, modularity, encapsulation, and minimal dependencies.
- Clearly state the rationale behind significant architectural decisions.
- Prompt user validation before applying large-scale or structural refactoring.
