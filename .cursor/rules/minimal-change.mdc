When suggesting code modifications, prioritize minimal, incremental changes that maintain functionality and readability. 
If multiple solutions or improvement options (e.g., Option 1, Option 2, Option 3) are available, do NOT implement them immediately. 
Instead, explicitly list the available options and request user confirmation or selection before proceeding. 
Avoid making multiple major changes simultaneously to prevent cluttering the codebase.
