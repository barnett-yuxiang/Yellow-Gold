# Minimal Change Principle
- Prioritize minimal, incremental changes that maintain functionality and readability.
- If multiple solutions or improvement options exist, explicitly list them and ask for user confirmation before proceeding.
- Avoid applying multiple major changes simultaneously to maintain codebase clarity and stability.
