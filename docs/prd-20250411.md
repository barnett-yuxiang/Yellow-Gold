## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Technology
- React 18+

- Vite for build and development
- Tailwind 3.x CSS for styling
- Material-UI components
- Emotion for additional styling needs
- react-toggle-dark-mode for theme switching, light or dark, light is default

### State Management
- React useState for component and application state
- Prop passing for component communication

### Performance Requirements
- Immediate visual feedback on color selection
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
