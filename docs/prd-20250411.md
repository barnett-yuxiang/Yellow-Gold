- Color enthusiasts
- UI/UX designers

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to select colors from a predefined palette to save time.
2. As a user, I want to input specific RGB values for precise color selection.
3. As a user, I want to mix two colors together to see the result.
4. As a user, I want to track my color mixing history for future reference.
5. As a user, I want to reuse previous color combinations from my history.
6. As a user, I want to reset my color selections and start over.
7. As a user, I want to toggle between light and dark modes for comfortable viewing in different environments.

### 2. Color Mixing
- Selection of two colors (Color A and Color B)
- Clear visual indication of currently selected color slot
- Mix button to combine colors
- Dropdown selection for different color mixing algorithms:
  - Simple averaging of RGB values
  - Weighted mixing
  - Subtractive color mixing
- Visual display of the resulting mixed color
- Reset button to clear all selections

### 3. Mix History
- Automatic recording of all color mixes
- Chronological display of mixing history
- Visual representation of input colors and result
- Ability to select previous combinations for reuse
- Timestamp for each mix record
- Persistent storage capabilities:
  - Synchronize color mix history from server
  - Upload current mix history to server for persistent storage
  - Clear all mix history records
  - Delete individual mix records
- Server operation state management:
  - Visual indicators for sync/upload operation status (idle, in-progress, success, failure)
  - Error handling with appropriate user feedback
  - Throttling to prevent excessive server requests

## User Interface

### Main Layout
- Clean, modern interface with color-based gradient background
- Header with application title
- Three main sections:
  1. Color Mixer (top)
  2. Color Palette (bottom left)
  3. Mix History (bottom right)
- Integrated header and navigation bar with:
  - Application title centered
  - Theme toggle and avatar aligned to the right
  - Avatar image with white circular stroke (using pre-defined lorene.png from repository)

### Color Mixer Section
- Two color blocks for input colors (A and B)
- Mix button with visual feedback
- Result color block
- Reset button
- Visual indicators showing the mixing equation (A + B = Result)
- Dropdown selection for different color mixing algorithms:
  - Simple averaging of RGB values
  - Weighted mixing
  - Subtractive color mixing

### Color Palette Section
- Grid layout of color swatches, 48 predefined colors
- Hover effects showing color information
- Organized arrangement of colors by family

### Mix History Section
- Scrollable list of previous mixes
- Visual representation of each mix (A + B = Result)
- Timestamp for each mix
- Empty state message when no history exists

### Theme Options
- Light mode (default) and dark mode options
- Theme toggle accessible in the navigation bar
- System theme detection and automatic application
- Color-sensitive UI elements optimized for both themes
- Appropriate contrast ratios maintained in both themes

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Technology
- React 18+
- TypeScript
- Vite for build and development
- Tailwind 3.x CSS for styling
- Material-UI components
- Emotion for additional styling needs
- react-toggle-dark-mode for theme switching

### Backend Services (Planned)
- RESTful API for mix history persistence
- Endpoints for:
  - Fetching saved mix history records
  - Saving current mix history to server
- Simple authentication mechanism for user identification
- Response status handling for:
  - Successful operations (200 OK)
  - Validation errors (400 Bad Request)
  - Authentication failures (401 Unauthorized)
  - Server errors (500 Internal Server Error)

### State Management
- React useState for component and application state
- Prop passing for component communication
- Local storage for temporary persistence
- Server synchronization for long-term persistence
- Operation state tracking:
  - Idle: Default state, no operation in progress
  - Loading: Operation in progress with visual feedback
  - Success: Operation completed successfully with confirmation
  - Error: Operation failed with appropriate error message

### Performance Requirements
- Immediate visual feedback on color selection
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

### Browser Support
- All modern browsers (Chrome, Safari)

## Future Enhancements (Potential)
- Color export in various formats (HEX, HSL, CMYK)
- Custom color palette saving
- Color scheme suggestions

## Implementation Notes
- Modern, clean, and intuitive UI is a priority
- Performance optimization for color rendering
- Clean component structure and separation of concerns
- Implementation approach:
  1. First phase: Develop frontend-only solution with in-memory storage
  2. Second phase: Implement local storage persistence
  3. Third phase: Add backend server integration for mix history persistence across devices
- Interface will primarily be in English, with Chinese used only where necessary
